# Project 3: Analyzing Students' Mental Health

## Description

This project aims to analyze the mental health of students using a dataset containing various survey responses. The analysis focuses on several key mental health indicators, and the goal is to derive insights that can help improve support for students. The project leverages SQL for data manipulation and analysis and Python (with pandas) for data processing and visualization.

### Key Features:
- **SQL Queries**: SQL queries are used to aggregate and analyze data, including calculating averages and counts based on student characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of survey responses from students. It includes various columns like survey scores, demographics, and other relevant mental health indicators. The dataset is stored in CSV format and is used as the primary source of data for this project.

### File Structure:

- **`data/`**: Directory where the CSV file containing the student dataset is stored.
- **`sql/`**: Directory where the SQL files with queries for data analysis are stored. Here, you might have a file like `analysis_query.sql` containing SQL queries for data aggregation and analysis.
- **`src/`**: Directory for Python scripts that process data, run the analysis, and generate visualizations. The `analyze_data.py` script is the main one for executing the calculations and generating graphs.
- **`README.md`**: File that describes the project, how to use it, and its functionalities.

This structure makes it clear what each part of the project is for and helps keep the code and data well-organized. If you have any more files or directories to add, you can easily extend this structure.
