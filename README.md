# Project 3: Analyzing Students' Mental Health

## Description

This project aims to analyze the mental health of students using a dataset containing various survey responses. The analysis focuses on several key mental health indicators, and the goal is to derive insights that can help improve support for students. The project leverages SQL for data manipulation and analysis and Python (with pandas) for data processing and visualization.

### Key Features:
- **Data Analysis**: The dataset is processed using pandas to clean, transform, and analyze mental health-related metrics.
- **SQL Queries**: Complex SQL queries are used to aggregate and analyze data, including calculating averages and counts based on student characteristics.
- **Data Visualization**: The results of the analysis are visualized using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to present the findings in a clear and informative manner.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of survey responses from students. It includes various columns like survey scores, demographics, and other relevant mental health indicators. The dataset is stored in CSV format and is used as the primary source of data for this project.
